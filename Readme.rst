Message Flasher
===============

The message flasher is an experimental tool for programming 
your subconscious with messages that you feel may be helpful, 
productive, and/or applicable to your situation.

It is based on the theory that there are processing mechanisms
in your brain that process many messages you are barely aware
of, which you are not even conscious of. These messages may
influence your beliefs and attitudes in subtle ways that lead
to their fulfillment.

================

Message Flasher is pretty straightforward. Each line of text
from the text box is flashed in a random corner of the screen
at the specified interval until a line with a  **.**  is 
encountered, at which point it loops back to the beginning. A
line beginning with the **#** sign is considered a comment.

 This line will not be displayed, thanks to the period above.
 Older messages can thus be saved below newer ones.
