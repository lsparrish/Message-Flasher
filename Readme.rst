Message Flasher
===============

The message flasher is an experimental tool for programming 
your subconscious with messages that you feel may be helpful, 
productive, and/or applicable to your situation.

It is based on the theory that there are processing mechanisms
in your brain that process many messages you are barely aware
of, which you are not even conscious of. These messages may
influence your beliefs and attitudes in subtle ways that lead
to their fulfillment.
